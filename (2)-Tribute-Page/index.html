        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Spinning Plate (Roundabout)</b> - Was insanely fun to be spun on. When it went too fast you would fall into the woodchips below. </li>
          <li><b>The Tiniest Slide</b> - An adventure, but before you know it you're at the bottom.</li>
          <li><b>Large Climbing Frame</b> - Spanned most of the park, but would be very busy at peak times as it was genuinely fun.</li>
          <li><b>Swings</b> - Very fun, but very few of them.</li>
          <li><b>Zip Line</b> - The best part of the park, but the seat always got stolen.</li>
          <li><b>Benches Everywhere</b> - For easy access to parents, who you would run to after getting another splinter.</li>
        </ul>
